I have created a Movie rating form that let users to store a movie and rating in the databse named as movies and in table named as movies.
It unables the user to enter ratings to the movie and thereafter it shows and calculate the average rating of movies stored in the database.
If you are using phpmyadmin then:-
Create three columns in the table movies named as user_name, user_movie, and user_rating.
If your using xampp then create a new folder inside htdocs folder in your C drive in xampp folder and name the folder as project.
Inside project folder save the above files as two seperate files named as below:-
Save the registration html file as registration.php 
and save the dbmovies php file as dbmovies.php
If you are using ubuntu then:_
Open the terminal and run mysql, create the database movies using mysql command and then create a table movies with three columns user_name, user_movie, and user_rating.
Then follow the above code to run the programme.
For your convinience, I have also attached screenshots of the pages that will be shown after the succesfull running of the above codes.
HAPPY CODING!!!!
