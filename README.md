I have created a Movie rating form that let users to store a movie in the databse named as movies and create a table named as movies 
It unables the user to enter ratings to the movie and thereafter it shows and calculate the average rating of movies stored in the database.
If your using xampp then create a new folder inside htdocs folder in your C drive in xampp folder and name the folder as project.
Inside project folder save the above files as two seperate files named as below
Save the registration html file as registration.php 
and save the dbmovies php file as dbmovies.php
